# Strings-and-2D-arrays
String is a sequence of characters. In java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created. A 2D array has a type such as int[][] or String[][], with two pairs of square brackets. The elements of a 2D array are arranged in rows and columns, and the new operator for 2D arrays specifies both the number of rows and the number of columns.
